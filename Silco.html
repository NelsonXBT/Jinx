        <h2>About Silco</h2>
        <p><strong>Silco</strong> is a key antagonist in Arcane, the Netflix series set in the League of Legends universe. A revolutionary from Zaun, he seeks independence from Piltover by any means, including violence and the use of the dangerous substance Shimmer. Once a close friend of Vander, their fallout led to a bitter rivalry. Silco becomes a father figure to Jinx, raising her in the chaos he helped create. Ruthless yet emotionally complex, Silco is a tragic leader driven by vision, pain, and sacrifice.</p>

            <h2>Silco Characteristics</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Strategic:</strong> Silco is a master manipulator and long-term thinker. He builds power not just with brute force, but through calculated moves and alliances.</li>
                <li><strong>Charismatic Leader:</strong> He commands loyalty from his followers in Zaun through vision and conviction. Many see him as the only hope for Zaun’s independence.</li>
                <li><strong>Ruthless:</strong> Silco will do whatever it takes to achieve his goals — including betrayal, violence, and sacrifice. He believes the end justifies the means.</li>
                <li><strong>Paternal:</strong> His bond with Jinx reveals a softer side. Despite his cold demeanor, he shows genuine love and protectiveness toward her, often putting her above his ambitions.</li>
                <li><strong>Ideologically Driven:</strong> Silco is not motivated by greed or chaos, but by a burning desire for Zaun’s freedom. His revolutionary ideals make him a complex, morally gray figure.</li>
                <li><strong>Traumatized:</strong> His past betrayal by Vander left deep emotional and physical scars, shaping his worldview and fueling his distrust and aggression.</li>
            </ol>
